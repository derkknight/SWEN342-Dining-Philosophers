--Program Terminates Normally--

//The configuration of two philosophers with one right-handed and one left-handed philosopher will always run to
//completion. Because there is one left-handed philosopher and one right-handed philosopher, both philosophers
//will reach for the same fork first. Whichever philosopher doesn't grab the fork first must wait until the other
//philosopher completes eating and releases both forks before attempting to eat again.

--Program Deadlocks, Terminated Manually--

//Unlike the scenario in Trace 1, with both philosophers being right-handed, both philosophers can grab a fork
//at the same time. However, since there are only two forks, if both philosophers grab a fork, then neither
//philosopher can begin eating since it is impossible to retrieve their other fork. Thus, deadlock.
